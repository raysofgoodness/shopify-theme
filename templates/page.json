We decided to take the benefits of ground-only shipping and make it available for anyone. Why? Because, on average, ground-only shipping is less carbon-intensive than air freight shipping. Plus, No Rush gives our teams a little extra time to prepare your order and get it out the door. We’ll still provide an estimated delivery date during checkout, so you’ll know when to expect your order. On rare occasions, there may be some operational overrides that cause your package to ship on a plane, but we’ll do our best to get your order shipped ground.<\/p><p><\/p><p><strong>Which carrier is delivering my order?<br\/><\/strong>When you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nike.com\/help\/a\/order-tracking\">track your package(s)<\/a>, you can see which carrier is delivering your shipment. Please note, if you order multiple items, you may have multiple deliveries and multiple carriers.<\/p>",
